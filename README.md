# Predict-Hazard-Ratings-for-a-Maintenance-Project
All the money in the world can not make up for a loss of life. Better safe than sorry is the motto of all engineering and construction practices which routinely deal with dangerous situations. However many times , extent of caution is just not enough and leads to very hard learnt lessons in employee safety . Instead of relying on something going wrong and then taking preventive measure ; organisations are coming up with ways of assessing the extent of danger to life for a new project before even the first hammer strikes . Given to you is a masked dataset which contains various properties of tasks taken up in heavy equipments maintenance by a manual crew. Each of these tasks have been given a hazard score which is eventually used in deciding levels of safety checks and caution while planning for the maintenance process.
